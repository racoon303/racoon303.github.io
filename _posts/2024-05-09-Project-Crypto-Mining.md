# Project Mining    ₿ ⛏️

This was a big side Project arround 2017-2018 ETH Ethereum
It all started with Bitcoin (around 90 CHF at the time) when I was still working with small USB miners to farm Bitcoin.  These USB miners were quickly replaced by ASIC miners and my USB miners were not profitable.
An ASIC miner would have cost me around 1300 CHF + electricity costs, this was not an option. I then used the money to buy Bitcoin and put it to the side. Later, when Bitcoin reached CHF 1000 at the time, I cashed out. Part of this money went into the Ethereum project. 

### Prototypes all sort of

Due to the overclocking I had several motherboards/CPU/RAM/graphics cards to test. Which combination of graphics card is the best (power consumption efficiency heat development).
Software/operating system was also an important point. Benchmarking was the order of the day.

Hardware Testing taking Notes \
Idea Modular frame with struts easy to adjust height and width. GPU hanging from the slot bracket. Ready for the first builds.

Depending on the CPU, each mainboard could accommodate 4 GPUs.

Cooling was also provided. The prototypes looked good and in the meantime new hardware arrived.
Mining mainboards and riser cards. However, it got too warm in the lab and we had to find a solution. Until the colleagues are ready. Until the colleagues are ready. Part of the system is moved to a basement, which is half an hour away. All systems set up, wired up, network set up, remote access done.

The next day I was notified that a system was offline and no longer responding. Remote access offline VPN no message from the worker. Called colleague and informed them to unplug the system, wait 30 seconds and plug it in the systems were set up so that if the power fails, the system automatically starts if the power returns.

I had to find a solution so that I can power cycle the workers if one goes offline. 
Side story: I already had the solution, I switched on the coffee machine in the lab via HomeAssistant with a relay. So that the coffee machine is warmed up when I arrive.
Now I had to apply this to the prototypes. One day later, the prototype was almost ready.

The prototype consisted of Raspberry Pi 3 An 8 channel relay board 3.3Volt 
Finder Relay 230V Packaged in a case for wallmount. After I tried the prototype and everything went smoothly, the demand for these boxes for friends and business partners increased. \
In the end we had developed a good design remote control and housing for the miners. \

All in all an exciting project. Learned a lot, met new colleagues, built business relationships. Would I build the whole thing again ? Yes, for customers who already have hardware or would like to buy more. I myself only sold the service (mining rig boxes remote access boxes and installation) and charge an X% of the generated turnover per month or year (passive income).
